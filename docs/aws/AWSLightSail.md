What is an Instance in Cloud Computing?
An instance in cloud computing is a server resource provided by third-party cloud services. While you can manage and maintain physical server resources on premises, it is costly and inefficient to do so. Cloud providers maintain hardware in their data centers and give you virtual access to compute resources in the form of an instance. You can use the cloud instance for running compute-intensive workloads like containers, databases, microservices, and virtual machines.

What is a AWS Lightsail instance?
A Lightsail instance is a virtual private server (VPS) that lives in the AWS Cloud. Use your Lightsail instances to store your data, run your code, and build web-based applications or websites.
