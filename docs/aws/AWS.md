# List of Amazon Services

* Amazon EC2:
Example: You can use Amazon EC2 to run a website or web application. To do this, you would launch an EC2 instance, install the necessary software and configure the instance to run your application, and then host your website or web application on that instance. You can also use EC2 to run other types of applications, such as machine learning models or batch processing jobs.

* Amazon S3:
Example: You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve files or objects, such as images or videos. For example, you can upload your files to an S3 bucket, which is a container for storing objects, and then retrieve those files from anywhere with an internet connection. You can also use S3 to host a static website, by enabling the static website hosting feature and configuring your website's content.

* Amazon RDS:
Example: You can use Amazon RDS to create a managed relational database in the cloud. For example, if you have an application that requires a MySQL database, you can launch an RDS instance running MySQL, and then connect your application to that instance. RDS takes care of managing the database, including backups, software patching, and scaling.

* Amazon DynamoDB:
Example: You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a highly-scalable NoSQL database in the cloud. For example, if you have an application that requires a flexible, low-latency database, you can create a DynamoDB table and store your data in that table. DynamoDB can automatically scale to handle high volumes of read and write traffic, and can be used for a wide range of applications, such as mobile and web applications, gaming, and IoT.
