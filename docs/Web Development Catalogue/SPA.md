# React project from scratch

Reference:Building Modern Projects with React by Shaun Wisel

What does React offer?
Provides a straightforward and powerful way to render data in the user's browser.
Efficiently updates the user interface in response to changes in the underlying data.
Provides little guidance on how to load, store, and manipulate this data, allowing developers flexibility to choose the best approach for their applications.

As a result, data loading and management logic often becomes tightly integrated into the components themselves. Consequently, vanilla React applications frequently feature large, complex components that handle all aspects of data management internally. 

If we can find a way to effectively identify and organize the many different types of concerns in an application, this goes a long way toward making our code base more maintainable. This brings us to SoC(Separation of Concerns).
