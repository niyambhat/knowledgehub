# Intro

Hello! My name is Niyam Bhat and I am a Software Engineer/Web Developer with 2+ years of work experience. I have a strong track record of building high-quality, performant, responsive, and complex web sites and web applications utilizing the best coding practices and web development standards. My skill set includes a solid understanding of web design & development, CMS, object-oriented programming, database, DOM, UI/UX, Automated Tests, Full-Stack Web Development, and relevant concepts.

## What got me into Programming?
In 2011, I began my studies in Electronics Engineering at a university in Beijing. During that time, I became acquainted with a friend from the USA who was passionate about website development using platforms such as Joomla and Drupal. Despite their efforts to share many tutorial videos with me, I was not initially interested. 


However, while traveling later on a trip from Beijing to Harbin to visit my girlfriend, I found myself with just a laptop and a piece of paper, and ended up stumbling upon an outdated tutorial that taught me how to code in Notepad. Despite feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information I had to remember, I persisted and managed to write an HTML script on paper to commit it to memory. Although I wouldn't recommend this method, it has become a habit of mine to always carry a piece of paper or a screenshot of programming-related content whenever I have the opportunity to learn.

## About me

I'm all about exploring the world, learning new things, and meeting new people. I have a serious passion for learning new languages, programming, and building websites. It's super exciting to constantly learn new things and then use that knowledge to create something cool.

When I'm not studying or working on a new project, I love to kick a soccer ball around, take photos, and jam out to my favorite bands like ACDC, GNR, and Dream Theater. I also enjoy trekking, hitting the gym, and spending time with animals.

I have a great sense of humor and I love making new friends. My friends often describe me as outgoing, friendly, and intelligent. I'm always happy to meet new people and gain new perspectives. With my love for adventure and learning, the world is my playground and I'm excited to see what's out there!
