## Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

2. Once installed, open VS Code to proceed with the next steps.

## Code Editor Setup:

1. Open VS Code and install any desired extensions or plugins for React development. Some recommended extensions include "ESLint," "Prettier," and "Reactjs code snippets."
2. Configure the extensions as per your preferences and project requirements to enhance your development experience.

## Wireframing the Application:

1. Use a design tool like Figma to create wireframes or visual designs of the web application's user interface (UI).
2. Focus on creating a clear and intuitive UI layout, incorporating relevant elements and considering user experience best practices.

## Setting Up React with Create React App:

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by selecting View â†’ Terminal.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project.
3. Run the following command to create a new React application using Create React App:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace "my-app" with the desired name for your project.
4. Wait for the project setup to complete, as it may take a few moments to install dependencies and set up the project structure.

## Removing Prebuilt Code in React:

1. Once the React project is set up, navigate to the project directory in VS Code using the terminal:
```
cd my-app
```
Replace "my-app" with the name you used for your project.
2. Remove the prebuilt code and files in the src folder, such as App.css, App.test.js, logo.svg, and App.js.
3. Customize and modify the remaining files and folders based on your project requirements, adding your own components, styles, and logic.

You are now ready to start developing your React application, customizing it to meet your specific needs.
