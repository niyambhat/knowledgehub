## Building the Layout

### Wireframing
Wireframing is a visual blueprint of a design that outlines the layout and structure of a digital product before detailed design and development. It helps in testing design concepts and identifying usability issues.

### UI Design:
The UI design phase involves the creation of the user interface by a UI designer. It is important to obtain the design if it has already been produced, otherwise, it needs to be built from scratch.
