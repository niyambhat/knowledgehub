# Little Lemons Front End Project

#### Pain Point:
Customers are experiencing difficulties when trying to book a table at the restaurant. The current booking process is unclear and confusing, and customers are not able to easily see the availability of tables or book a table at their desired time. This leads to frustration and a poor customer experience, and it may result in lost business as customers may choose to dine at other restaurants that have a more user-friendly booking system.

#### Proposed Soulution 
To address this issue, Little Lemon can implement an online reservation system that allows customers to easily view table availability and book a table at their desired time. The system could be integrated into the restaurant's website or mobile app, providing a seamless user experience for customers. Additionally, the restaurant could offer incentives for customers who book online, such as discounts or special promotions. By implementing a user-friendly reservation system, Little Lemon can improve the customer experience and increase customer loyalty.
